# Fault Detection in Wastewater Treatment Plants: Application of Autoencoders with Streaming Data
The objective of this work is to use Artificial Neural Networks, more specifically Autoencoders, to design a fault 
detection system for the dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor, present in the aeration system of the biological reactor of a 
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).

## General Information
- This work originated a paper that was presented at the 7th Workshop on Data Science for Social Good - [SoGood 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/ecmlpkddsogood2022/home?pli=1), 19-23 September 2022, in Grenoble, France.
- The objective of this work is to develop a failure detection system for the dissolved oxygen sensor of a WWTP biological reactor.
- ANN models used for fault detection:
   * Convolutional Autoencoder
   * Long short term memory (LSTM)
